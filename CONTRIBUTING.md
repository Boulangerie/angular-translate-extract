## Pull Requests

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è  üëÆ **Please follow our commit message conventions** even if you're making a small change! This repository follows the
[How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)
series on egghead.io (by yours truly). See
[this lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-writing-conventional-commits-with-commitizen?series=how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)
and [this repo](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)
to learn more about the commit message conventions.

If you would like to add functionality, please submit [an issue](https://github.com/Boulangerie/angular-translate-extract/issues)
first to make sure it's a direction we want to take.

Please do the following:
* Follow the existing styles (we have an `.editorconfig` file)
* Document your changes in the README (try to follow the convention you see in the rest of the file)
* Create an example for the website that demonstrates your changes so people can see how your changes work

### Development

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm test`
3. write tests & code in ES6 goodness :-)
4. run `git add src/`
5. run `npm run commit` and follow the prompt (this ensures that your commit message follows [our conventions](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)).
6. notice that there's a pre-commit hook that runs to ensure tests pass and coverage doesn't drop to prevent the build from breaking :-)
7. push your changes
8. create a PR with a link to the original issue
9. wait patiently :-)

#### Notes

- Please don't commit any changes to the `dist/` directory. This is only committed for releases.
- Due to some inconsistencies with angular versions, always use `require('angular-fix')` rather than simply `require('angular')`
- If you wish to view your changes visually, you can play around with it in the `local-examples` directory. Don't commit anything in this directory, but it's a good sanity check. It's just straight JavaScript with an `index.html`. I recommend `http-server`.
